Flower gardens can turn an ordinary area into a colorful showcase or create a border that pops. Whether you choose an easy to manage perennial or a particularly touchy annual, growing flowers is a rewarding addition to any yard or landscape.
Who can resist their delicious fragrance? And the more you pick, the more flowers they produce! The large seeds of sweet peas are easy to handle, but if sowing sounds complicated then buy them as sweet pea plug plants! A sunny spot, a supportive fence, and plenty of water is all these climbers need to produce your own 'home grown' cut flowers. Just keep an eye out for troublesome slugs and snails - they love the young shoots.
